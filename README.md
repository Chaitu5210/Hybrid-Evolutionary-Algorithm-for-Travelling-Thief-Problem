# Hybrid-Evolutionary-Algorithm-for-Travelling-Thief-Problem
This academic project focuses on developing a Hybrid Evolutionary Algorithm for the Travelling Thief Problem, which optimizes travel routes and item selection using genetic operators and local search to balance distance and profit constraints. Contributions are welcome, and we look forward to seeing your input!
